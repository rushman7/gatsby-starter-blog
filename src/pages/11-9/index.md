This first week introduction to Labs has been an eye opener and a glimpse into
the professional developer life. I saw what it meant to work with a team of 
colleagues in a development environment and how challenging it can be to co-work
with people on projects that can easily break one-another. This week and for the
coming weeks my primary focus will be back-end web development. That stack our group
chose was React-Apollo(redux replacement)-GraphQL(Back-End)-Prisma(DB) with my 
primary focus being Prisma. One of the first biggest challenges i faced was for
obvious reason, learning Prisma. It's never easy learning a new development package
that you've never used before especially with the time crunch we have it was 
imperative that we have it up and running before the weekend. Fortunately we were
able to meet MVP expectations and go above and beyond this week with getting 
user authentication up and running via bcrypt and jwt on the back-end as well as
multiple well designed components on the front-end via React.

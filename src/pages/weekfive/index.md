## Weekly Question

This week felt so fast in terms of time, everyone was rushing to complete
what remains of the styling of the project. We all felt a strong sense of
incompleteness with the project, the idea that something is never truly 
finished expressed itself throughout almost every aspect of our project.
This week we re-did our mockups of every layout and focused on making
it look more professional. This week wasn't really related to bugs as we 
had fixed all of our kinks prior to this week, it was all mostly involved
in styling and then re-styling what we created because we weren't pleased
with the product. 

* Documentation:
  * The tech stack used to build the project:
    * We decided to test ourselves in a real world environment with our
      our choice in stack. We chose a complete overhaul over what was taught
      in Lambda School, aside from of course React which in my opinion 
      is a dominant front-end stack amongst component based web-apps. For our
      back end we set aside REST API's and chose GraphQL. To compliment GraphQL
      we have Prisma for our DB which can manage multiple DB's and condense them
      into one super DB. To connect GraphQL to React we used Apollo which is
      essentially a redux replacement.
  * Cookbook is a web application that allows users to add recipes from any
    website into their collection of recipes. Allows them to easily search
    and filter through recipes and view all of the information for any recipe.
    Plan meals by scheduling recipes for any amount of days and also generate
    a grocery list of the ingredients you'll need for a customized date range.
